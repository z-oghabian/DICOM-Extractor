# DICOM-Extractor

**DICOM-Extractor** is a tool designed to simplify the process of extracting and organizing DICOM files into structured patient and series-based folders. Many MRI scanners produce unsorted or ambiguously labeled DICOM files, making it challenging to identify and organize series. While software like RadiAnt or DicomWorks can help, the process is often time-consuming. This tool aims to streamline that workflow.
